# AirSpace
Our project tokenizes air rights as NFTs, enabling secure trading of airspace above prime real estate. Using privacy-focused smart contracts, we verify ownership while keeping data encrypted. A 3D interactive UI visualizes building heights, zoning limits, and purchasable airspace. Buyers can secure unobstructed views and developers can monetize.
